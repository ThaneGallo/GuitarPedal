# Abstract 
  A custom reprogrammable guitar pedal using C++ for drivers and digital signal processing to allow for emulation of analog pedals.

#Intro 
  This project was began after my other music related project as it sparked an interest in muscial technologies as well as my interest of embedded system design. The original idea was to create an analog pedal however I would want the most functionality with the least amount of effort for the user this led me to the conclusion that I would need a digital system as I would be theoretically able to reprogram, adjust, and add lots of options for use including but not limited to:

  * Delay 
  * Gain 
  * Distortion 
  * Filters
  * Etc


As this system contains custom hardware and software I decided to split up into other files for ease of reading with the links below:
